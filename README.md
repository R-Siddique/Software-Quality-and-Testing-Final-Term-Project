ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: 

This project was developed as part of the Software Quality Assurance and Testing course during the Summer 2022â€“2023 semester. Our goal was to simulate a real-world QA process by designing and testing an educational web platform called Code Lab, which was also our project. The project covered requirements gathering, test plan development, test execution, and defect documentation, mimicking a full software testing lifecycle.

ðŸ§  What We Learned:

Through this project, we gained valuable hands-on experience with industry-standard QA practices, including:

Writing detailed Test Plans, Test Cases, and Test Reports.

Applying various testing techniques such as unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.

Using tools like Selenium IDE for automation and understanding bug tracking processes.

Learning how to maintain testing documentation and ensure traceability from requirements to test results.

This exposure gave us a clearer understanding of how quality assurance operates in real-world software development environments.

ðŸš§ Challenges We Faced:

Despite our accomplishments, we encountered several key challenges:

Dealing with ambiguous software requirements that required clarification.

Gaining familiarity with new tools and techniques under tight deadlines.

Ensuring effective collaboration and document consistency across the team.

Maintaining a balance between theoretical standards and real-world constraints.

Overcoming these hurdles enhanced our adaptability and problem-solving skillsâ€”traits crucial in any QA role.
